        <blockquote>
          <p>And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. […] And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language that they may not understand one another’s speech. (<em>The King James Bible</em>, Gen. 11.1-7)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Where did all of our linguistic issues start? Who had the great idea of having us all speak different tongues so that we could not understand each other? Many thinkers have taken a shot in the dark trying to answer those questions, and most of them have landed in the same place: the tower of Babel.</p>
        <p>One day, humans decided to build a tower so high it would reach the heavens. Their God punished them with many different languages, so that they could not understand each other and any ambitious enterprise in the future would become impossible… at least that is what the Bible, “the book of books” according to George Steiner, says.</p>
        <p>However, thinking of the richness of languages and dialects in time and space as a <strong>punishment</strong> leaves us—at least it leaves me—with an awkward feeling, unsettled and, why not say it, dissatisfied. Many have tried to overcome <strong>the curse</strong> of Babel by inventing a new universal language that all human beings should, ideally, learn to perfection, so that we could end, once and for all, with all of our problems and communication issues.</p>
        <p>Ludoviko Zamenhof created Esperanto with the hope that we would all have a common language. John Wilkins set himself to create a philosophical language allowing us, by means of a system of classification and synthesis, to talk about everything in this world. In reality, though, no one uses these utopian languages to communicate—regardless of the efforts of the Universal Esperanto Association (or <a href="https://www.uea.org">Universala Esperanto-Asocio</a>)—, and we need to wonder why.</p>
        <p>Evidently, I do not have a definite answer. No one can know for sure why, after so many years, we have not decided to put a stop to this and united all of our efforts to learn a truly universal language that is not subject to change as economical power shift or because of a new craze for a culture and its language.</p>
        <p>As I said, it is commonplace to think of Babel’s tower and what it symbolises as a punishment, a curse, a terrible event for humanity… but the emphasis is rarely on what this lack of communication actually gives us. Many years after Babel, people wrote about the prophets who “began to speak with other tongues” (Acts 2.4) and about the gifts of God, including “divers kinds of tongues” (1 Cor. 12.10). It is thanks to the diversity of languages that we have a myriad of resources stemming from the difference and aimed at the adaptation of what is said in one language to another.</p>
        <p>Words such as fiancé and fiancée (from French), mosquito (from Spanish), poltergeist (from German), barista (from Italian), and many others have been adopted from other languages and into or day-to-day conversations as ours. Of course words are ours because we communicate with them, but it has not always been the case. The complex linguistic processes of borrowing and translating, of rejecting and adapting are an essential part of human life. These chances, though imperceptible, are the cause and consequence of cultural and social transformations that we cannot stop from happening. Languages have a life of their own, and the linguistic ecosystem is so wide that a lifetime is not enough to cover it all.</p>
        <p>How could something that is so imbued with life and so familiar to us be a punishment?</p>
        <p>The Paradise of Babel celebrates the lack of mutual understanding as a booster for communication, a seed for undertakings that, from all fields, advocate for differences and try to create a bridge between them. Let us talk about words, dialects, translations, and intercultural influences, not in the terms of what is “lost in translation” nor of the “curse of Babel”, but rather with our eyes wide open and with the willingness to be surprised by all that can be gained when we attempt translation, all that can be discovered thanks to linguistic diversity.</p>
